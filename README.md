# Bank-Application
The Simple Banking Application is a web-based mini project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register, log in, view account balance, and perform basic operations like deposit, withdraw, and fund transfer. User data is stored using browser LocalStorage, so the application works without a backend or database.
